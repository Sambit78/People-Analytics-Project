# 1.2 Conducting Levene's test to test equality of variances ----

# One important assumption of the Independent-Samples t Test is that the variances in the 
# sample groups are approximately equal or that the samples have homogeneity of variance. 
# Leveneâ€™s Test for Equality of Variances is a test of whether the variances of the 
# two samples/groups are approximately equal. 
# Null Hypothesis : There is no difference in the variance between Training methods

#Levene's needs Training method to be a factor variable

Method <- factor(`Training Method`,
                      labels = c("Training Method A", "Training Method B"))
Freq1=table(Method)
Freq1

leveneTest(`Test Scores`, group = Method, center = mean)

# If you leave out the center=mean it will use the median which is also known as 
# the Brown-Forsythe test for variances

leveneTest(`Test Scores`, group = Method)

# 1.3 Conducting Independent T Test - Equality of Means ----

# Assuming variances are equal based on Levene's Test
# Null Hypothesis : Their is no difference in mean scores from the 2 training methods

t.test(`Test Scores`~`Training Method`, var.equal=TRUE)

              + age1 + age2 + age4 + age5 + age6 + age7 + age8 + age9 + age10 + Training + ScanPminute,data = Train_Intervention)
